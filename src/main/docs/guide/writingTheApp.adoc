Create an app using the Micronaut Command Line Interface.

[source, bash]
----
mn create-app example.micronaut.complete
----

NOTE: Starting with Micronaut 2.2.0 you don't need to select the `graalvm` feature anymore.

The previous command creates a Micronaut app with the default package `example.micronaut` in a folder named `complete` and with support for GraalVM.
